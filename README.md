 The following is a program developed by David Reynolds. This program
 calculates the trajectories of ballistic objects and objects under thrust.
 This program takes into account drag, the rotation of the earth, change 
 in gravity, atmospheric properties as a function of height and change in
 drag coefficient as a function of mach number.
